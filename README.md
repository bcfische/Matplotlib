Here, we're given a complete recordset of rides for a fictional ride sharing company. The data contains information about every
active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type. The objective is to
build Bubble Plots that showcase the relationship between four key variables:
~Average Fare ($) Per City
~Total Number of Rides Per City
~Total Number of Drivers Per City
~City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, we aim to produce the following three pie charts:
~% of Total Fares by City Type
~% of Total Rides by City Type
~% of Total Drivers by City Type

This exercise uses the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries with Jupyter Notebook.
